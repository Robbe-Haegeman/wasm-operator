# Kubernetes Operators in WebAssembly

This repository contains the code of a prototype runtime for running Kubernetes operators in WebAssembly. The goal is to improve the memory usage of a Kubernetes cluster by reducing the memory footprint of operators. This prototype reduces the overhead in three ways.

* It runs operators in a shared WebAssembly runtime to reduce the overhead of containerization.
* It swaps operators to disk when there are no changes to process.
* It uses the Rust programming language instead of Go.

For more information, read the paper [Adapting Kubernetes controllers to the edge: on-demand control planes using Wasm and WASI](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.01077) accepted to CloudNet 2022.

This project builds upon [this proof of concept](https://github.com/slinkydeveloper/extending-kubernetes-api-in-process-poc).

## Run all e2e tests and benchmarks (old)

```console
> ./full_test/run.sh
```

## Run wasm test only

```console
> ./full_test/run_wasm.sh
```
